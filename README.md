# Deployment and DevOps for MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on deploying a full MERN stack application to production, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and setting up monitoring for your application.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Prepare your MERN application for production deployment
2. Deploy the backend to a cloud platform
3. Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
5. Implement monitoring and maintenance strategies

---

## üìÇ Tasks

### Task 1: Preparing the Application for Deployment
- **Frontend (React):**
  - Run `npm run build` in `/frontend` to generate static assets for production.
  - Code splitting is enabled by default with React and Vite.
  - Use `.env.local` for environment variables (see template below).
- **Backend (Express):**
  - Error handling and logging are implemented (see code).
  - Secure HTTP headers can be added with `helmet` (see below).
  - Use `.env` for environment variables (see template below).
  - Health check endpoint is available at `/health`.
- **MongoDB:**
  - Use MongoDB Atlas for production database.
  - Ensure proper user permissions and IP whitelisting.
  - Mongoose handles connection pooling by default.

### Task 2: Deploying the Backend
- Deploy backend to Render (or Railway/Heroku).
- Set environment variables in Render dashboard.
- Set up GitHub integration for continuous deployment.
- (Optional) Configure a custom domain and HTTPS.
- Server monitoring via Render dashboard and `/health` endpoint.

### Task 3: Deploying the Frontend
- Deploy frontend to Vercel (or Netlify/GitHub Pages).
- Configure build settings (`npm run build`).
- Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
- Set up GitHub integration for continuous deployment.
- (Optional) Configure a custom domain and HTTPS.
- Caching is handled by Vercel for static assets.

### Task 4: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (see `.github/workflows/` for templates).
- Workflows should run tests, lint, and build both frontend and backend.
- Configure automatic deployment on successful builds.
- (Optional) Set up staging and production environments.
- (Optional) Implement rollback strategies.

### Task 5: Monitoring and Maintenance
- Health check endpoint: `/health` (returns server and DB status).
- Uptime monitoring: Use services like UptimeRobot or Render's built-in monitoring.
- Error tracking: Integrate with Sentry or similar (not yet implemented).
- Performance monitoring: Use Render/Vercel dashboards, or add tools like New Relic (not yet implemented).
- Maintenance: Schedule regular updates, plan for DB backups, and document deployment/rollback procedures.

## üåê Deployed Application URLs
- **Frontend:** [mern-book-store](https://mern-book-store-taupe.vercel.app/)
- **Backend API:** [mern-book-store](https://https://mern-book-store-bhny.onrender.com)
- **Health Check:** [https://mern-book-store-bhny.onrender.com/health](https://mern-book-store-bhny.onrender.com/health)

---

## üì¶ Environment Variable Templates

### `/frontend/.env.local.example`
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://mern-book-store-bhny.onrender.com
```

### `/backend/.env.example`
```
DB_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Production Build & Optimization
- Run `npm run build` in `/frontend` to generate optimized static assets.
- Code splitting is enabled by default with Vite/React.
- Use environment variables for API URLs and secrets.

---

## üîí Security & Error Handling
- Backend uses CORS and environment variables for security.
- Add secure HTTP headers by installing and using `helmet`:
  ```sh
  npm install helmet
  ```
  In `backend/index.js`:
  ```js
  const helmet = require('helmet');
  app.use(helmet());
  ```
- Error handling and logging are implemented in backend routes.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Backend (Render)
1. Create a new Web Service on Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repo and select the backend folder.
3. Set environment variables (`DB_URL`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`).
4. Deploy and monitor logs for errors.

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Import your repo into Vercel.
2. Set build command to `npm run build` and output directory to `dist`.
3. Set environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
4. Deploy and test the live site.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
- Add GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` for frontend and backend.
- Example workflow for frontend:
  ```yaml
  name: Frontend CI
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Install deps
          run: npm install
        - name: Build
          run: npm run build
        - name: Lint
          run: npm run lint
  ```
- Example workflow for backend:
  ```yaml
  name: Backend CI
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Install deps
          run: npm install
        - name: Test
          run: npm test
  ```
